Some musings on features
========================

A few things that should be considered for change once the MVP is operational.

1) The default option is inherently dangerous as it will delete the DeleteFiles class, so consider perhaps ignoring the specific deletion of:
        a) All class files - but that limits scope
        b) Just reflect and do not delete itself
        
2) A feature to be added should be exclusion fileextensions ed all but ...

3) Ultimately incorporate the idea of an "action file" being read in, which could contain all the switches, as a json file (for the practice)

4) Figure out how to bundle the thing up as an exe and / or with its own jre

5) Revisit Eclipse autorun jar bundling

6) Generalise the ars parsing routine, possibly incorporate Regex
